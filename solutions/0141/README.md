## 141. Linked List Cycle

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.

Return _`true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`._

### Examples

See on LeetCode.

<br>

### Constraints

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range $[0; 10^4]$.
- $-10^5 \leqslant$ `ListNode.Val` $\leqslant 10^5$
