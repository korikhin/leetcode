## 16. 3Sum Closest

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

Return _the sum of the three integers_.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

### Example 1

```
Input: nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

### Example 2

```
Input: nums = [0, 0, 0], target = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
```

### Constraints

- $3 \leqslant$ `len(nums)` $\leqslant 500$
- $-1000 \leqslant$ `nums[i]` $\leqslant 1000$
- $-10^4 \leqslant$ `target` $\leqslant 10^4$
