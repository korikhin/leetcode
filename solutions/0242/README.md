## 242. Valid Anagram

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` _if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise._

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Example 1

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

### Example 2

```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

### Constraints

- $1 \leqslant$ `len(s)`, `len(t)` $\leqslant 5 \cdot 10^4$
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.
